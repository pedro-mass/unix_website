							The Unix file system is a bit different from the Windows file system you may
							be used to. The Unix file system is best described as being like the roots of 
							a tree. The top level is called root and is represented by a slash /. Everything 
							grows down from the root.

							Type the above command into the terminal and press enter. We will learn more
							about this command later, but pwd will shows you where you are in the filesystem.
							You can see that it starts with a slash, this is the root. It then shows the next folder:
							home which leads you to your login folder. This is where you will land on every login.
