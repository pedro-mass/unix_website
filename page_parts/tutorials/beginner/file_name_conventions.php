<h2>File name conventions</h2>

<p><em>Note: These conventions should also be followed for naming directories</p></em>

<p>
When naming a file, you should avoid using any special characters such as: 
/  		-> used for delineating directories(ex. root/docs/)
*, &, and %	-> used for regular expressions when searching
</p>

<p>
	Another thing to avoid is using spaces in file names. Reason being is it makes 
	it difficult for the shell to determine if what is on the terminal is a single 
	file or multiple.
</p>

<p>
	Later on we'll take about copying and moving files but lets just talk about what 
	that command requires.
