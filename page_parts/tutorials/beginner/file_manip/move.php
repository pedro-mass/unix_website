						<p id="stage_description">
							Similar to copy, to delete a file or directory you 
							use the same command:
							<strong>mv source destination</strong>.
							
							This has a similar syntax to that of the copy 
							command. The difference is that instead of leaving 
							the original where it is, it moves to the new 
							destination. As a result, you end up with one file, 
							rather than two.
