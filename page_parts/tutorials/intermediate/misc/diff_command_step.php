						<p id="stage_description">
							If you end up creating multiple versions of a file, a useful command 
							to find changes is the diff comand. The command when used can compare 
							the contents of two files or two directories. We will use the files "newfile"
							that you created with vi, and the file "cat" we used for wildcards.
						</p>

								Code example:

								<code>diff newfile cat</code>	
						</p>
						
						<p id="stage_steps">
							There are many options that can be used with diff. Some ones you may want to try
							include: -i which will ignore changes in case, -q which will report whether or not 2
							files are different and -w which will ignore any white-space in the files.
