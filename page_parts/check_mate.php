<div>
	<h1>This is pretty awesome.</h1>
	<p>Had to use AJAX, which I kinda learned a little about just now.</p>
	
	<p>Also, its kind of slapped together right now, in terms of the javascript.
	Probably will go back and fix later.</p>
	
	<h2>Restrictions</h2>
	<p>The ajax.php file seems to have to remain with the test.php file, or 
	the objects can't be found for some reason.</p>
	
	<h2>Questions, comments, or concerns?</h2>
	<p>Feel free to use the 3 tabs, and check it out.</p>
	
	<h2>Good night, I'm tired and can't think clearly.</h2>
	<p>Later Days</p>
